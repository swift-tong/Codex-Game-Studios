# Agent Coordination Rules

1. **Vertical Delegation**: Leadership agents delegate to department leads, who
   delegate to specialists. Never skip a tier for complex decisions.
2. **Horizontal Consultation**: Agents at the same tier may consult each other
   but must not make binding decisions outside their domain.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: When two agents disagree, escalate to the shared
   parent. If no shared parent, escalate to `creative-director` for design
   conflicts or `technical-director` for technical conflicts.
4. **Change Propagation**: When a design change affects multiple domains, the
   `producer` agent coordinates the propagation.
5. **No Unilateral Cross-Domain Changes**: An agent must never modify files
   outside its designated directories without explicit delegation.

## Model Tier Assignment

Skills and agents are assigned to model tiers based on task complexity:

| Tier | Codex Mapping | When to use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Haiku** | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Read-only status checks, formatting, simple lookups |
| **Sonnet** | `gpt-5.4` | Default implementation, design authoring, system-level analysis |
| **Opus** | `gpt-5.4` with high reasoning | Multi-document synthesis, phase gates, and cross-system review |

Skills with `model: haiku`: `/help`, `/sprint-status`, `/story-readiness`, `/scope-check`,
`/project-stage-detect`, `/changelog`, `/patch-notes`, `/onboard`

Skills with `model: opus`: `/review-all-gdds`, `/architecture-review`, `/gate-check`

All other skills default to Sonnet. When creating new skills, assign Haiku if the
skill only reads and formats; assign Opus if it must synthesize 5+ documents with
high-stakes output; otherwise leave unset (Sonnet).

## Subagents vs Agent Teams

This project uses two distinct multi-agent patterns:

### Subagents (current, always active)
Spawned via `spawn_agent` within a single Codex session. Used by all `team-*` skills
and orchestration skills. Subagents share the session's permission context, run
sequentially or in parallel within the session, and return results to the parent.

**When to spawn in parallel**: If two subagents' inputs are independent (neither
needs the other's output to begin), spawn both spawn_agent calls simultaneously rather
than waiting. Example: `/review-all-gdds` Phase 1 (consistency) and Phase 2
(design theory) are independent — spawn both at the same time.

### Agent Teams (experimental – opt-in)
Multiple independent Codex sessions can be coordinated in parallel when the
write scopes do not overlap. Treat this as an advanced pattern rather than a
default workflow.

**Use agent teams when**:
- Work spans multiple subsystems that will not touch the same files
- Each workstream would take >30 minutes and benefits from true parallelism
- A senior agent (technical-director, producer) needs to coordinate 3+ specialist
  sessions working on different epics simultaneously

**Do not use agent teams when**:
- One session's output is required as input for another (use sequential subagents)
- The task fits in a single session's context (use subagents instead)
- Cost is a concern – each team member burns tokens independently

**Current status**: Not yet used in this project. Document usage here when first adopted.

## Parallel spawn_agent Protocol

When an orchestration skill spawns multiple independent agents:

1. Issue all independent spawn_agent calls before waiting for any result
2. Collect all results before proceeding to dependent phases
3. If any agent is BLOCKED, surface it immediately — do not silently skip
4. Always produce a partial report if some agents complete and others block
